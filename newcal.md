To run the improved love calculator example provided earlier, you don't need any external Python libraries. The example uses only standard Python libraries.

However, if you plan to add more features or improve the user interface, you might need some additional libraries. Here are a few common libraries you might consider:

For a Graphical User Interface (GUI):

tkinter (built-in Python library, no need to install)
PyQt5: pip install PyQt5
Kivy: pip install kivy
For Web Development:

Flask: pip install Flask
Django: pip install Django
For Data Handling and Visualization:

pandas: pip install pandas
matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
If you have a specific feature or improvement in mind, please let me know, and I can suggest the appropriate libraries and installation commands.
